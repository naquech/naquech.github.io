*“Hypothesis testing in statistics is a way for you to test the results of a survey or experiment to see if you have meaningful results.”*

This is the second project in this program, the goal was to test the ability to gather information and perform statistical analyses following the scientific method structure. 

We were provided with a relational database file sourced from Microsoft’s fictional company “Northwind Traders” and an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) to look at the relationships of entity sets. 
We were also given one statement to perform a hypothesis test on it and were asked to formulate other statements according to our own analysis of the database.

To start off I wrote down a series of steps to follow in the process, first was to get familiar with the database, so I created an independent Jupyter notebook to have a better visualization of the tables and their information, this is where my sql queries were executed before moving them to the presentation notebook. 

This was the brainstorming session! By looking at the dataframes and along with the ERD I was able to make statements, get ideas and question the relationship between some attributes and move onto step two in the process.
Now, for each statement/ question there we certain sub-steps such as translating them onto null and alternate hypothesis, the way the hypothesis were stated would define the type of test run on them, this was the challenging part, for this I had to have a clear understanding of the type of data I was dealing with and what comparisons I wanted to make.  

The next step was collecting the data necessary and perform the test, most of this queries were run on the database notebook, and last but not least, the interpretation, according to the test results determine the validity of the claims, reject or not reject the null hypothesis.

This was a fun project; it felt overwhelming at the beginning because of the amount of statistical concepts and formulas around the different types of tests; but fear not, practice makes perfect and stating the most simple question can lead to deep learning.
