Data visualization is how you translate numeric algorithms into images. Their purpose is to help the human brain to process complicated information in a quick and easy way. It’s a field that has been evolving specially in the past few years due to the increase amount of data that emerging technologies are generating. 

Visualizations are a science on its own, trying to find the best visual tool that delivers the most information is not an easy task. Thankfully, there are many tools to try… and fail.  Visualizations can take the form of simple pie charts, bars, dashboards or complicated spider charts. The key point is to choose a model that best represent and explain the information you are trying to convey.
 
I am now in the process of exploring data and getting familiar with some of these visual tools. During the first project, which was mainly about data exploration, I found scatter plots to be the best visualization tool when trying to find a correlation in between features.

A scatter plot is a type of diagram used to display a (x, y) relationship; in other words is a collection of points that creates patterns. These patterns determine whether the two variables we want to compare move in the same direction, opposite or have no direction at all (meaning the points don’t seem to resemble any kind of pattern); and as everything else in the world, they cannot be perfect (not a bad thing). 
One advantage of scatter plots is that they display positive and negative correlation; they also show all data points including outliers, maximum and minimum values. These characteristics provide assistance during the data cleaning process.
The biggest limitation is that you cannot display the correlation of more than two points. 

For now, they satisfy my requirements: are simple to use, easy to understand and provide insight into the relationship of two variables.
