title: Why Data Science?
---

<p>I have been exposed to various elements of Data Science for sometime now; statistics in high school, building a robot arm in my early 
college days, developing applications and websites later.  Completing a course about artificial intelligence at  the University of 
Helsinki  sparked my interest in pursuing a career in Data Science. By the way, I highly recommend the course for those who are interested 
in learning the basics of AI and how it can solve problemsâ€¦ real life problems.</p>

<p>I was surprised to learn that Data Science is the umbrella for multiple disciplines including Statistics, Robotics, Computer Science, 
and Web Development. By becoming a Data Scientist I will be able to integrate these disciplines, manage and analyze unstructured data 
to help businesses deliver better solutions.</p>
