title: Online Resources for Data Science

Stack Overflow is a great platform to ask or to find answers about a specific problem in programming but sometimes you just want to look at a definition or find a reference that tells you how a method works or what parameters to include.  
Here are a few of what have become my favorite resources for the first modules of the course (*I have them as bookmarks on my browser for easy access*)

*  <a href="http://overapi.com" style = "color:blue">OverAPI</a> offers cheat sheets for almost every technical subject  (Git, Python and MySQL included!!)

Most of the following websites will have a box for a quick search, just type in the term, module, class or function that you are looking for. Also, keep in mind that you need to match the version of what you have installed as some classes or methods become deprecated with newer versions.

* <a href="https://www.python.org/" style = "color:blue">Python's</a> website is a good source not only for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/py-modindex.html"  style = "color:blue">documentation</a> but also for tutorials.

### **Python Libraries**

*  <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html" style = "color:blue">Pandas</a> documentation. Find the search-box at the end of the Table of Contents on the left side.

* Plotting with <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" style = "color:blue">matplotlib</a>

* <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/" style = "color:blue">Numpy</a> reference

### **Mathematics**

* <a href = "http://mathworld.wolfram.com/" style = "color:blue">Wolfram Mathworld</a> is a mathematics encyclopedia that includes subjects such calculus, probability and statistics among others.

* From the same Wolfram family comes <a href = "https://www.wolframalpha.com/" style = "color:blue"> Wolfram Alpha,</a> where you can run examples and get step by step solutions.

### **Online Compiler**

If you need to compile your code or just use an editor for a few lines of code, <a href = "https://repl.it/languages" style = "color:blue">rpl</a> offers a wide variety of languages (Python is listed as the most popular).

### **Jupyter Notebook Viewer**
<a href = "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/" style = "color:blue"> Project Jupyter </a> offers a notebook viewer, just plug in the full address of the .ipynp file. For now it only "supports launching notebooks stored on GitHub or as Gists on Binder."

### **Databases**
#### Relational
Both <a href ="https://sqlite.org/lang.html" style = "color:blue" > SQLite </a> and MySQL <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-syntax.html" style='color:blue'>(SQL Statement Syntax)</a> documentation are easy to follow. SQLite shows a roadmap for every statement which makes it easier to understand.
