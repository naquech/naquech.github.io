Sentiment analysis combines text analysis techniques to extract information from texts written by a person; since people’s feelings and opinions are, for the most part, subjective, the findings cannot be conclusive and the analysis will not be 100% accurate. What these analyses can do is group sentiments and give us insights into a group’s behavior.  

With the vast amount of data generated mainly by social media outlets, sentiment analysis has become a popular tool used by businesses and people to try and get a better understanding about opinions and trends to make better and more informed decisions, or simply to classify beliefs.

While doing my project analyzing twitter posts about global warming I realize that sentiment analysis can be a field of study on its own. Preparation is different for each problem; it starts simple but gets difficult as you apply tasks and procedures unique to the type of data (text) you are working with. I applied deep learning techniques such as LSTM and GRU networks, in the future I’d like to compare these results to a Naïve Bayes classifier.
Something I observe in the results of my models was how the Neutral classification was leaning more towards the positive category. So, how do we define neutral, how relevant is this category when analyzing text? Something to work on next time…
